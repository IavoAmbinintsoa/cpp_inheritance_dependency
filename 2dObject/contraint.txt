The goal of this exercise is to practice inheritance and namespaces in C++ by modeling a simple system that includes infrastructure and people entities.

Instructions

1. Class Design

Create a base class Infrastructure that represents a general structure.

Derive a class Etablissement from Infrastructure, representing an institution.

Derive a class Hopital from Etablissement, representing a hospital.



2. Person Hierarchy

Create a base class Personne with general attributes and methods.

Derive a class Etudiant from Personne, representing a student.

Derive a class Medecin from Personne, representing a doctor.



3. Namespace Organization

Use the namespace Individu to group all person-related classes (Personne, Etudiant, Medecin).

Use the namespace Place to group all infrastructure-related classes (Infrastructure, Etablissement, Hopital).
